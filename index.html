                                For now it's clean & minimal. With that said I wanted to spice things up
                                with how information would be displayed so I made these expanding/minimizing
                                animations you see here. The way it works is I've got some "reference" buttons
                                that are hidden. The position and size of these buttons is used to inform
                                the manually created buttons (which have absolute positioning) where they
                                should go in the screen.
