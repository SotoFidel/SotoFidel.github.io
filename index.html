                                For now it's clean & minimal. With that said I wanted to spice things up
                                with how information would be displayed so I made these expanding/minimizing
                                animations you see here. The way it works is I've got some "reference" buttons
                                that are hidden. The position and size of these buttons is used to inform
                                the manually created buttons (which have absolute positioning) where they
                                should go in the screen.

                                A simple drawing utility made in javascript. You can change the color and 
                                size of the brush you use, and undo your mistakes should you make one.
                                I've always been curious about the techniques that go behind making a drawing
                                application, regardless of tech stack. This exercise taught a lot about the basics
                                of making things work in real time as the user interacts with the software,
                                as well as the types of trickery and math involved in order to make it all work
